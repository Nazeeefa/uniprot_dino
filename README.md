# Information

The project is based on following steps:

Create a BLAST database containing all UniProt sequences from Dinoflagellate organisms.

Link: ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz

Create SQL database containing important annotation data such as Gene Ontology terms, protein description, taxon path, and so on.

Write a script that extracts data, and create a web interface using CGI.

The web interface can be accessed at http://binp00.mbfys.lu.se/~bio1702
